		<p>The tools used for this project were an Iphone 6s and Adobe Premiere. The inspiration for this was the recent school shooting in Feburary. The concept is about a cycle; the first stage is the occurance of mass shooting. Next, you have the mourning stage. Lastly, you have a debate over gun control. This cycle has been repeated over and over for every massive school shooting like Sandy Hook.</p>
