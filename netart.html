	<h1>Net Art</h1>
	<p>My inspiration comes from the common usage of internet. We have become so accostumed to the online world that we cannot imagine a life without it.
	All information from Wikipedia, Youtube, Etc., are the main source of informations. It also includes your favorite news source: FoxNews, New York Times, and even Facebook. Yes, I am not joking when I listed Facebook as people's source of news because that is what is actually happening. The unfortunate truth is that information itself is malleable. It is now easier to spread misinformation and fabricated stories on the internet. Even more so, you will start seeing people creating their own truth, their own reality. What is true or false is even harder to decide, people will still believe in them because 1) they do not bother to check the stories and 2) they like what they are hearing.</p>
	<p>This project was made with adobe illustrator. In this game, you will be simulating an average person's experience of reading stories. Simply, most people read the headlines, but does not bother to read the content. Even more, some misformation and headlines can be misleading. Press "Start Game" below to begin the NetArt Project and read the instruction provided.</p>
