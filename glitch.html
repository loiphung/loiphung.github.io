	<p>The tools I used for this art were Audacity and NotePadplus. I do not have an inspiration for this one as well because it was part an assignment. There are no concept or meaning beside this work because it is purely for fun and experiment. I messed around settings in Audacity and mixed up some codes with the text-editor to reach the results.</p>
