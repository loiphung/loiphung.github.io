	<h1>Remix Digital Collage</h1>
	<img src="images/remixart.jpg" alt="government collapsing" id="remix">
	<p>This is my work for digital collage. The tools I used for this work Adobe Photoshop. I do not have any particular inspiration for this because it is more of a fun excerise for me. The concept is base on the reflection of the United State. As you can see, the country, or government, is slowly crumbling along with internal and external conflicts. Some of the symbolisms you might recognizes that represent the current conflict with our nation. </p>
